# LeanWorkspace

A workspace for Lean examples

In an attempt to learn Discrete Mathamatics, I decided to use Lean Proof Assistant to check my proofs and maths. I originally tried to use "Mechanics of Proof by Heather Macbeth but that seems to miss some introductiory material (I'm guessing in her lectures).

<https://hrmacbeth.github.io/math2001/> - Mechanics of Proof website

<https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001> - Github repository

<https://github.com/hrmacbeth/math2001/tree/main/Math2001>  The books text source.

I found "Lean-First-Steps" <https://github.com/rzeta0/Lean-First-Steps> which helpfully includes YouTube lectures <https://www.youtube.com/@LeanFirstSteps>

I'll work on that awhile before retackling "Mechanics of Proof".
